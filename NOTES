Automata rules for traversing the edge of a square cluster:
  1) Turn left when possible or go straight or right; in that order
  2) Never traverse to an inner/covered node
  3) Never traverse to a clear node (implied by left hand turn) unless drawing a sqaure
  4) Never traverse to an edge node only occupied by another automata's square cluster
  4) Don't traverse to double edge node unless all other options have been exhausted 
  5) Stop and go to drawing mode when there is free space on the right 

Automata rules for drawing a square:
  1) Check the sizes of any adjacent squares and take a random proportion of the largest as the desired size of the new square
  2) Turn right to draw the first edge perpendicular to the existing edge
  3) Count the number of nodes successfully traversed between corners
  4) Never traverse to an inner node
  5) Never traverse two consequetive double edge nodes
  6) If the way is blocked, reduce the square size to the number of nodes successfully traversed on the current side and restart drawing the square
